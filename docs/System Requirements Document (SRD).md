## 1. Introduction

The CARE project aims to provide a robust and comprehensive solution for coastal erosion risk estimation through real-time monitoring, data processing, risk evaluation, alerting, and visualization. This document outlines the functional, non-functional, dependencies, and assumptions that form the basis of the system's design and implementation.

### 3.1 Data Collection

- **CARE-010**: The system shall be capable of retrieving SSH data from Sentinel-3 satellites every 6 hours.
- **CARE-280**: The system shall validate the integrity of all incoming data from Sentinel-3 and other sources, rejecting any corrupted or incomplete data.

### 3.2 Data Preprocessing

- **CARE-020**: The system shall preprocess the collected SSH data within 2 hours of retrieval.

### 3.3 Erosion Pattern Analysis

- **CARE-030**: The system shall analyze erosion patterns with a spatial resolution of at least 100 m.
- **CARE-040**: The risk analysis shall be completed within 3 hours of data collection, synchronous with data preprocessing.
- **CARE-050**: The horizontal resolution of erosion risk retrievals shall be identical to erosion pattern analysis.

### 3.4 Monitoring, Alerting, and Reporting

- **CARE-060**: The system shall provide real-time monitoring with a latency of no more than 5 minutes.
- **CARE-070**: The system shall issue alerts for high-risk areas within 10 minutes of detection.
- **CARE-080**: The system shall create visualizations, maps, and reports within 5 minutes of a user's request.

### 3.5 User Interaction

- **CARE-090**: The system shall allow at least 3 customizable settings for authorized users.

### 3.6 Availability and Backup

- **CARE-190**: The system shall be designed for 24/7 availability, with a maximum unplanned downtime of 2 hours per month.
- **CARE-200**: The system shall provide backup and recovery mechanisms to ensure data integrity and availability.
