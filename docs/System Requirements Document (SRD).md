# System Requirements Document (SRD) - CARE Project

## Introduction

The CARE project aims to provide a robust and comprehensive solution for coastal erosion risk estimation through real-time monitoring, data processing, risk evaluation, alerting, and visualization. This document outlines the functional, non-functional, dependencies, and assumptions that form the basis of the system's design and implementation.

### Monitoring, Alerting, and Reporting

- **CARE-060**: The system shall provide real-time monitoring with a latency of no more than 5 minutes.
- **CARE-070**: The system shall issue alerts for high-risk areas within 10 minutes of detection.
- **CARE-080**: The system shall create visualizations, maps, and reports within 5 minutes of a user's request.

### User Interaction

- **CARE-090**: The system shall allow at least 3 customizable settings for authorized users.

### Availability and Backup

- **CARE-190**: The system shall be designed for 24/7 availability, with a maximum unplanned downtime of 2 hours per month.
- **CARE-200**: The system shall provide backup and recovery mechanisms to ensure data integrity and availability.
- **CARE-220**: The system shall allow for updates to be applied with minimal disruption, not exceeding 1 hour of downtime per update.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Accuracy and Data Quality

- **CARE-100**: The contribution of system errors to coastal erosion risk estimation shall be less than 0.5%.
- **CARE-290**: The system shall maintain a data accuracy rate of at least 99.5%, with a quality assurance process in place to detect and correct errors.

### Continuity and Consistency

- **CARE-110**: The system shall maintain continuity and consistency in data processing and risk evaluation across different coastal regions.
- **CARE-130**: The system shall be designed to support at least a 50% increase in data volume without degradation of performance.

### Response Time

- **CARE-120**: The response time for user interactions shall be less than 2 seconds.

### Security

- **CARE-140**: The system shall implement security measures that withstand industry-standard penetration tests.

- **CARE-260**: The system shall encrypt all sensitive data, both in transit and at rest, using industry-standard encryption protocols.
- **CARE-270**: The system shall conduct regular security audits and address all identified vulnerabilities within 1 month.

### Compliance

- **CARE-150**: The system shall comply with all relevant ECSS standards, with zero non-compliance issues.
- **CARE-180**: Assumes compliance with all relevant environmental and data privacy regulations.

### Monitoring and Alerting

- **CARE-210**: The system shall include real-time monitoring tools to track system health and alert administrators of any potential issues.

### Compatibility and Versioning

- **CARE-230**: The system shall support backward compatibility for at least two previous versions of processed data.
- **CARE-310**: The system shall provide data versioning to ensure the reproducibility of results and traceability of data processing changes.

### Maintenance and Documentation

- **CARE-240**: The system shall include documentation for all maintenance activities and shall be updated within 2 weeks of any changes.

### Data Retention

- **CARE-300**: The system shall retain all processed data for a minimum of 5 years, with mechanisms for secure archival and retrieval.

## Dependencies and Assumptions

- **CARE-160**: Dependent on regular and reliable access to Sentinel-3 data, with no more than 2 hours of downtime per month.
- **CARE-170**: Assumes availability of supplemental coastal, weather, and tidal information, with at least 98% coverage of the relevant coastal areas.
- **CARE-180**: Assumes compliance with all relevant environmental and data privacy regulations.
