## Overview

UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams are used to visualize the design, structure, and behavior of our system.

## How to View Diagrams

The diagrams are saved as `.plantuml` files. To view them you can:

- Install the [PlantUML plugin](https://www.plantuml.com/) for your preferred IDE or viewer.
- Use online tools like [PlantUML Online Server](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml) to view and render the diagrams by uploading or pasting the `.plantuml` content.
- Navigate to the folder [docs/images](docs/images) where the UML are saved as `PNGs`.
