# CARE - Coastal Analysis & Risk Evaluation System

CARE is a system designed to monitor and analyze coastal erosion patterns using data provided by Sentinel-3. The system processes raw images and other telemetries, applies edge detection and other algorithms to recognize erosion patterns, and offers real-time monitoring and alerting functions.
